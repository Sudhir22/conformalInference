# Conformal Inference
This repository contains code to use various feature selection methods in machine learning models. Lot of times, we have limited data with high dimensionality. <br>
In those cases, it is important to find features which are most important for prediction. This repository provides code for some of the well known feature selection algorithms such as:

1. Max-Relevance Min-Redundancy (MRMR)- http://home.penglab.com/papersall/docpdf/2005_TPAMI_FeaSel.pdf <br>
2. Split Conformal Inference- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04173.pdf <br>
3. Leave one covariate out (LOCO)-  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04173.pdf  <br>


I will be adding other algorithms as well in the near future. <br>


The examples folder contains some test code for using the above algorithms
